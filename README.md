 <strong>Danger: This branch contains unfiltered, unorganized files.</strong>
</h4>

<strong>Note: The staging area is used for temporary storage of proclamations before they're cleaned, checked and moved to the master branch. If you want to clean some proclamations for moving, please fork the project, clean the documents/proclamations and submit a pull request.</strong>

Open collection of proclamations of the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia. Government sites are usually not always running and even when they are they are either too slow or completely unresponsive so this repository serves the purpose of serving as a central repository of proclamations from the House of Representatives.

## Folder Organization
Proclamations are organized in folders named after the gregorian-calendar year they were released (e.g. Proc No. 2-1995 is in the 1995 folder).

The format of each proclamation file is in the format of: `Proc No. <procno>-<year> (<abstract>)` where:

  * `<procno>` is the incrementing ID of the proclamation (1, 2 etc.)
  * `<year>` is the year the proclamation was released in
  * `<abstract>` is the brief abstract that describes the purpose of the proclamation

## Contribution
If you would like to contribute proclamation documents, please use the following steps:

 1. Fork the repository in GitHub
 2. Clone your forked repository on your local computer
 3. Add the proclamations in the correct folder, using the correct naming format (above)
 4. Commit the files with a proper commit message (look at existing messages for example)
 5. Send in a pull request!

If there are any issues with the pull request or if you have any additional comments,  you can add them in the pull request.
