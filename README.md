# Federal Negarit Gazeta
Open collection of proclamations of the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia

## Organization
Proclamations are organized in folders named after the year they were released (e.g. Proc No. 2-1995 is in the 1995 folder).

The format of each proclamation file is in the format of: `Proc No. <procno>-<year> (<abstract>)` where:

  * `<procno>` is the incrementing ID of the proclamation (1, 2 etc.)
  * `<year>` is the year the proclamation was released in
  * `<abstract>` is the brief abstract that describes the purpose of the proclamation
